As part of some hopefully future planning I'm moving from eleventy to astro.  While Eleventy was what I needed to serve some static blog posts part of what I hope to do in the future is add a little more interactivity.  Astro is better suited for this task as it lets me customize more of the functionality in a way that is familiar to me (javascript).  Also it's a no-javascript-by-default framework which is really important because I don't want to have scripts and other stuff when they are not truly necessary.  While I could have written my own site generator (and have) I just wanted something with less maintenance on my end which is why I went off-the-shelf.  I guess that would be where I go next if this is not suitable.

I wanted to write a whole blog about the process but it was surprisingly straight-forward.  The docs and some googling had everything I needed, no real notes.  Seems like a good sign, but I'm also not trying anything fancy yet.
