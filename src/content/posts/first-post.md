This is the first post of the blog, currently built by [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

This is my first real experience using eleventy.  I'm starting from scratch and landed on the `.liquid` templating.  I picked it mostly because that was what the tutorial I followed did and I needed to pick _something_.  I expect this site won't look good for a while and I'll need to learn a lot more to really get the value I want.  There's already so awkward things about the setup, but overall I'm like Eleventy so far.  It's a bit magic, but low config.
