            <p>I like grounded content more than off-the-cuff opinion pieces but I felt it might be a bit fun (for me at least) to put up some predictions and thoughts around the Steamdeck as it's new entry into the portable gaming space.  The idea is that I feel I have an understanding about the gaming industry and can thus make decent predictions.  But I want it to be granular and accountable.  It's easy to say &quot;I called it&quot; especially with an unnuanced opinion on whether something will &quot;succeed&quot; or not. Instead I want to call what people will like and dislike about it, what problems will exist and what things will be unimportant.  I also want to do it before there are any sales figures to bias my own recollection about being on the correct side of history so I can look bad and judge myself somewhat objectively.  Steamdeck is good because it's pretty open-ended, I have the foundation (I think), and seems to have some amount of hype going for it.  Let's dive in.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it will initially attract a lot of attention but gradually fade as the hype wears down.  I suspect it will keep a lot of happy fans.</p>
<h2>x86</h2>
<p>This I think will be an issue.  It's an ARM world now and I just don't see x86 having the right tradeoffs for something this small.  Specifically I think battery will be an issue.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>Linux compounds the above problem.  Since games have to run through proton they will be sipping even more overhead.  It creates an odd chicken-and-egg problem too.  Why invest in Linux ports if Proton is actually good?</p>
<h2>PC games aren't a fit for portables</h2>
<p>Valve is certainly giving many control options but that's a bit of a band-aid.  These won't work quite as well in terms of control but even more-so in terms of general usability.  PC games can already have a tough time with things like text size, games shrunk down to a 7 inch screen they were never tested on are going to have issues.  In fact games that work well on portables are designed that way taking into account how they are played in shorted bursts.</p>
<h2>A Steam library is less interesting than it sounds</h2>
<p>Backwards compatibility is always the most wanted feature and least utilized.  People mostly want new games and exclusives.  This isn't to say Steam won't have exclusives but unless they are optimized I'm not sure it will matter much.</p>
<h2>Alternate OS isn't a mainstream thing</h2>
<p>Most people won't change the OS.  In fact, I think few people realize that a Windows license costs about $140 if you don't already have one from a PC build.  Windows 10 is yet another thing that sucks battery as it's designed to do a lot more than a mobile OS.  I'm not sure Windows is good experience on such a small device either.</p>
<h2>PC games are huge</h2>
<p>PC games can get upwards of 100GB.  There is no real thought given to size which means storage will be a big factor.  PC games simply don't optimize this way.  You might be using low-end textures but still need the space to store the high-quality versions because platform-specific bundles aren't a thing on PC.</p>
<h2>The device is overly complicated</h2>
<p>Multiple touchpads seems like a mistake.  It makes the unit a lot bigger.  I understand it's to make things more PC compatible but that's the issue itself.  Back paddles are overkill too.  Ideally a single touchscreen should have been enough to deal with most pointer-centric games.  Certainly configuring controls for every games is going to be an annoyance.</p>
<h2>Configuration is the worst part of PC</h2>
<p>The configuration only gets worse on a handleheld where untested DPI and power settings come into play in addition to the above control issues.  Nobody wants to spend the time setting that up.</p>
<h2>It's big</h2>
<p>It's even biggest than a switch which is already pushing into table territory.  I'm sure people will make it work but it seems to be pushing the size barrier to it's limits.</p>
<p>These are what I think will be the major pain points.  Whether that's enough to dampen the product will remain to be seen, certainly there's a lot of early optimism.  The launch itself will be crucial.  Unforeseen defects (this always happens), customer service (Valve is typically bad here) and the like will really make or break it.</p>
<h2>It might not matter much anymore</h2>
<p>Nintendo Switch has gone a long ways to cover a lot of PC only titles in portable form.  It's a lot cheaper, a much more mature device and it's very well designed for what it's doing especially since all versions are optimized.  If Doom Eternal is the best showcase you have I think it's an upward battle because you can still get that on Switch.</p>
<h1>Things Valve can do to mitigate the problems</h1>
<h2>Get more Steamdeck targeted games</h2>
<p>If developers are testing and building specific modes and profiles that will go a long way, even if it is just checking things like display and control settings.  I don't suspect it will be pushed to it's limit though.  They need to sell a lot, that's what will really move this needle.</p>
<h2>Simple profiles</h2>
<p>Profiles for controls and performance settings can help ease the pain of configuration but not every game will have it.  But the big ones should.</p>
