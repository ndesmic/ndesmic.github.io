pageTitle: "Halo CE: Revisiting 15 Years Later"
---

Over Christmas I recieved the Master Chief Collection for PC.  It's been quite a while since I've played a Halo game having skipped the Xbox One X entirely.  Even though I'm not so excited for Halo Infinite at this point something did get me in the mood for Halo.  Lucky for me Microsoft ported it to the PC (well except 5, which is the only one I haven't played).  It's been interesting revisiting one of my favorite game series after so long, and especially the older ones which I haven't touched in at least a decade.

The anniversary part is prety

I've played Halo: Combat Evolved to death and have very fond memories of it, both multiplayer and co-op.  I did previously beat the game on legendary and so I thought with all that behind me it only made sense to do a legenday run.

## The Pillar of Autum

This level was never my favorite.  It's an introduction but nothing especially interesting happens.  It also isn't too hard made up of mostly linear cooridors and not too many elites, enocunters which become the choke points throughout the game.  You also start with the pistol which is nice.  The pistol for those unfamilar is perhaps the best weapon in the game, or at least for a starting weapon (subweapon no less!) it's entirely overpowered.  Head shots will take down any enemy, it's pretty fast and has 2x zoom.  You can pair it with a charged shot from the plasma pistol to 2-shot elites.  I plowed though this level pretty quickly and was quite pleased with myself.

## Halo

Here's where it gets a bit harder and the game really starts to shine with big open areas and vehicle battles.  The first encounter is already fairly nasty as you need to survive a dropshop, a roaming banshee and a second wave up in the rocks before the first checkpoint.  From there it's not too bad aside from activating the undeground bridge.  While the warthog gunner helps a little you just don't have the firepower to take down the 5 or so elites gaurding the switch.  It's especially bad as they ambush you right as you try to climb the ramp meaning you really need to be ready for it.  This part took me several tries.  Afterward is probably one of the more memorable parts of the game, you get a choice of 3 areas to go to and fight a few waves of enemies to save some marines.  Of course on legendary marines typically don't last more than a 15 seconds before getting demolished.  The game is nice enough to not let you save them, so long as you try.  Driving the warthog around is lots of fun but it's really geared toward co-op.  If you're lucky you can get a marine to stick around and be gunner for you but they don't always target what you want, leaving you to carefully drive donuts around the target and not catch a grenade.  In this game they won't drive and let you take the gun which was a welcome addition in Halo 2.

## Truth and Reconciliation

This level sucks.  You start with the sniper which is cool and super useful but the level is ugly and the checkpoints are simply awful.  As you approach the ship your routinely need to battle multiple waves between checkpoints and there's not an abundance of cover.  The actual ship area is probably the hardest part in the game.  You need to fight 6-7 waves of enemies before the checkpoint to use the gravity lift.  I took maybe 10 tries to get it and even then I was running low on ammo which is something that never happens in Halo.  You also get introduced to hunters which are played up like a mini-boss but are complete pushovers as you can fight them like a matador.  On the ship I got very lucky.  You get ambushed by about 5 gold sword elites.  I was expecting more deaths but I got it in about 3 with a bunch of lucky grenade tosses. I still have PTSD from doing that part in the past.  The rest of the ship is a slog.  It's an ugly purple, it's boring, you don't get any good weapons unless you saved your sniper rifle (it's worth saving).  The end is also huge pain.  You rescue Keyes and need to escort him out of the ship.  Unfortunately, the level ends if he's killed and he's really good at getting himself killed.  On Legendary, much of it is simply luck with the AI that he doesn't eat a grenade or too many needler shots.  This took probably another 10 tries.  In the end I felt pretty soured because this level is just not fun.

I also notice that Anniversary has some annoying stuff going on with hit detection.  Since they went ahead and spruced up the geometry it doesn't always align with the old geometry which is what's used to calculate hit detection.  So sometimes your hiding place isn't so hidden as enemies will shoot through part of the wall or your sniper shot impacts invisible walls.  To combat this I spent a lot of time in the old graphics to be sure I was seeing was real.  Definitely annoying that I have to think about it.

## The Silent Cartographer

A great pallet cleanser from the last level.  This is perhaps the most well known and well-loved level in the game and it's blissfully short and filled with good action.  You start with a group of marines storming a beach.  About 30 seconds in you'll be the only one standing and need to slowly fight your way through the rest to get the warthog.  With no more marines, it's not that useful except to move around the map more quickly though.  You can fight some elites up on a ledge but those that have played it before know you quickly come to a locked door and are asked to explore more so instead you can skip those fights and go straight through the middle of the island.  Battle some hunters (easy) and at the end there's an alcove where you can press a switch to open the door.  You get the first rocket launcher but it's not too useful here.  I took it with me anyway down into the depths of the map room, you can score some easy elite kills with it at least.  On your way out you get the rocking Halo battle theme playing which make you feel great.  This level still has it.  And it's not the repeatitive either which start becoming a problem....

## Assualt on the Control Room

...now.  This level starts off with 2 elites in the first 2 seconds.  You need to grenade just to give yourself breathing room.  Then you make your way through these convex polygonal rooms seperated by bridges.  I think you need to go through 3 to get to the meaty part of the level and it's pretty fatiguing even if the combat is decent.  Outside you get one of my favorite sections where you get to do some vehicle battles in a scorpion tank.  This part is a lot of fun using the unlimited ammo cannon to just trash stuff but enemies are smart enough to not make it trivial on legendary.  All good things come to and end though and you're forced out of the tank and back into the towers of polygon rooms and bridges.  There's a fun gimick in some where you use stealth to kill all the sleeping grunts and patrolling elites without being seen but it's not enough to save your from the slog of constantly repeating scenery.  The end is fun though.  If you are quick you can kill and elite and skip more boring rooms by taking his banshee and bombing the crap out of stuff all the way to the exit.  

I remember this level being one of my favorites but the repetition is just brutal.  High highs but low lows.  Definitely do the end shortcut, I couldn't wait for the level to be over.

## 343 Guilty Spark

I remember this being one of my less liked levels but it's really not bad overall and also another one on the shorter side.  The repetition really starts setting in though.  You start in a swamp and make your way indoors which is a bunch of identical looking square rooms seperated by cooridors.  The encounters are pretty easy, and it sets up some tension before you finally release...the Flood!  The flood I think got a bad rap.  They aren't nearly as annoying as I remember.  They aren't smart but their head-on attacks and squishy bodies make for a nice change in combat pace.  You also get the shotgun which is never not fun to use at point-blank.  Another fun trick is to shoot their arms off and watch as they powerlessly try to hug you.  So you fight your way out and end up back in the swamp.  The latter part is tough to navigate as you can never tell which direction you are going but eventually you meet the titular, smug, Guilty Spark.

## The Library

Barf.  Perhaps the most infamous level in Halo.  It's loooooong, it's super repeatitive, it's dark and it's ugly.
