pageTitle: "Halo CE: Revisiting 15 Years Later"
---

Over Christmas I recieved the Master Chief Collection for PC.  It's been quite a while since I've played a Halo game having skipped the Xbox One X entirely.  Even though I'm not so excited for Halo Infinite at this point something did get me in the mood for Halo.  Lucky for me Microsoft ported it to the PC (well except 5, which is the only one I haven't played).  It's been interesting revisiting one of my favorite game series after so long, and especially the older ones which I haven't touched in at least a decade.

The anniversary part is pretty interesting.  The graphics were enhanced to look a bit more like Halo 3 but what's really cool is the ability to switch back and forth between them in real time.  I really appreciate this detail as it doesn't lock you in, sometimes you want to remember what it looked like in the old graphics.  There are a few quirks though.  The animation is the same so it can look a bit wierd and you can't change graphic style while in the middle of a cutscene.  For the most part I kept the new graphics, except where it became a bit of a problem.  Since they went ahead and spruced up the geometry it doesn't always align with the old geometry which is what's used to calculate hit detection.  So sometimes your hiding place isn't so hidden as enemies will shoot through part of the scenery or your sniper shot impacts invisible walls.  It's definitely a problem that sometime you have to think about it but I can understand the trade off.  The music is remastered too, but it would have been interesting to get the old stuff too with the switch of a button as well.

The collection also has it's own set of controller configs.  I was a bit puzzled that they didn't have a classic Halo CE setup.  The difference is that reload/activate is handled by the X button (before the X button was taken over by other functions).  I have muscle memory for this so I was really disappointed.  It doesn't even make sense to put the flashlight on the primary button either but you aren't allowed to customize beyond what it gives you.  Before I got even there I tried to play with mouse and keyboard and it just felt weird.  Even if the aiming is better I just can't deal with faster paced games that have a ton of inputs on a keyboard, I need them split between the hands to be more manageable.

I've played Halo: Combat Evolved to death and have very fond memories of it, both multiplayer and co-op.  I beat the game on legendary a long time ago and so I thought with all that behind me it only made sense to do a legenday run.

## The Pillar of Autum

This level was never my favorite.  It's an introduction but nothing especially interesting happens.  It's made up of mostly linear cooridors and not too many elites; encounters which become the choke points throughout the game.  You also start with the pistol which is nice.  The pistol for those unfamilar with Halo CE, is perhaps the best weapon in the game, or at least for a starting weapon (subweapon no less!) it's entirely overpowered.  Head shots will take down any enemy, it's pretty fast and has 2x zoom.  You can pair it with a charged shot from the plasma pistol to 2-shot elites.  I plowed though the level pretty quickly and was quite pleased to see I still remember a lot of it.

## Halo

Here's where it gets a bit harder and the game really starts to shine with big open areas and vehicle battles.  The first encounter is fairly nasty as you need to survive a dropshop, a roaming banshee and a second wave of enemies up in the rocks before the first checkpoint.  From there it's not too bad aside from activating the undeground bridge.  While the warthog gunner helps a little you just don't have the firepower to take down the 5 or so elites gaurding the switch.  It's especially bad as they ambush you right as you try to climb the ramp meaning you really need to be ready for it.  This part took me several tries.  Afterward is probably one of the more memorable parts of the game, you get a choice of 3 areas to go to and fight a few waves of enemies to save some marines.  Of course on legendary marines typically don't last more than a 15 seconds before getting demolished.  The game is nice enough to not let you save them, so long as you try.  Driving the warthog around is lots of fun but it's really geared toward co-op.  For the single player, if you're lucky you can get a marine to stick around and be gunner for you but they don't always target what you want, leaving you to carefully drive donuts around the target and not catch a grenade as enemy shots slowly chip your health away.  In this game the AI won't drive but luckily they updated that in the sequel.

## Truth and Reconciliation

This level sucks.  You start with the sniper which is cool and super useful but the level is ugly and the checkpoints are simply awful.  As you approach the ship your routinely need to battle multiple waves between checkpoints and there's not an abundance of cover and it's easy to get surrounded.  The gravity lift area is probably the hardest part in the game.  You need to fight 6-7 waves of enemies before the checkpoint to use the gravity lift.  I took maybe 10 tries to get it and even then I was running low on ammo from being pinned down for so long which never happens elsewhere.  You also get introduced to hunters which are played up like a mini-boss but are complete pushovers as you can fight them like a matador.  On the ship I got very lucky.  You get ambushed by about 5 gold sword elites just as you enter.  I was expecting more deaths here but I got a few good grenade tosses. I still have PTSD from doing that part over and over in the past.  The rest of the ship is a slog.  It's an ugly purple, it's boring, you don't get any good weapons unless you saved your sniper rifle (definitely save it).  The end is also huge pain.  You rescue Keyes and need to escort him out of the ship.  Unfortunately, the level ends if he's killed and he's really good at getting himself killed.  On Legendary, much of it is simply luck with the AI that he doesn't eat a grenade or too many needler shots.  This took probably another 10 tries.  In the end I felt pretty soured because this level is just not fun.

## The Silent Cartographer

A great pallet cleanser from the last level.  This is perhaps the most well known and well-loved level in the game and it's blissfully short and filled with good action.  You start with a group of marines storming a beach.  About 30 seconds in you'll be the only one standing and need to slowly fight your way through the rest to get the warthog.  Unfortunately, With no more marines, it's not that useful except to move around the map more quickly.  You can fight some elites up on a ledge but those that have played the level before know you quickly come to a locked door and are asked to explore more so instead you can skip those fights and go straight through the middle of the island.  Battle some hunters (easy) and at the end there's an alcove where you can press a switch to open the door.  You get the first rocket launcher immediatly after but it's not too useful here.  I took it with me anyway down into the depths of the map room, you can score some easy elite kills with it at least.  On your way out you get the rocking Halo battle theme playing which make you feel great.  This level still has it.  And it's not very repeatitive either which starts becoming a problem....

## Assualt on the Control Room

...now.  This level starts off with 2 elites in the first 2 seconds.  You need to grenade just to give yourself breathing room.  Then you make your way through these convex polygonal rooms seperated by bridges.  I think you need to go through 3 to get to the meaty part of the level and it's pretty fatiguing even if the combat is decent.  Outside you get one of my favorite sections where you get to do some vehicle battles in a scorpion tank.  This part is a lot of fun using the unlimited ammo cannon to just trash stuff but enemies are smart enough to not make it trivial on legendary.  All good things come to and end though and you're forced out of the tank and back into the towers of polygon rooms and bridges.  There's a fun gimick in some where you use stealth to kill all the sleeping grunts and patrolling elites without being seen but it's not enough to save you from the slog of constantly repeating scenery.  TThe end is fun though.  If you are quick you can kill an elite on a bridge and skip more boring rooms by taking his banshee and bombing the crap out of stuff all the way to the exit.  

I remember this level being one of my favorites but upon replay the repetition is just brutal.  This level could have trimmed like 4 or 5 of polygon rooms as they add nothing. Definitely do the end shortcut as by then the level has overstayed its welcome.

## 343 Guilty Spark

I remember this being one of my less liked levels but it's really not bad overall and also another one on the shorter side.  The repetition really starts setting in though.  You start in a swamp and make your way indoors which is a bunch of identical looking square rooms seperated by cooridors.  The encounters are pretty easy, and it sets up some tension before you finally release...the Flood!  The Flood I think got a bad rap.  They aren't nearly as annoying as I remember.  They aren't smart but their head-on attacks and squishy bodies make for a nice change in combat pace.  You also get the shotgun which is never not fun to use at point-blank.  Another fun trick is to shoot their arms off and watch as they powerlessly try to hug you.  You fight your way out and end up back in the swamp.  The latter part is tough to navigate as you can never tell which direction you are going but eventually you meet the titular, smug, Guilty Spark.

## The Library

Perhaps the most infamous level in Halo.  It's loooooong, it's super repeatitive, it's dark and it's ugly.  I braced myself for a grind but you know what?  I didn't hate it.  The anniversay graphics help quite a bit here as they're a lot more pleasing to look at and don't need the stupid flashlight. You need to get the shotgun as fast as possible because no other weapon will let you stay alive.  Not only does it insta-kill most flood at a decent range where most other weapons take half a clip, but it holds a lot of shells compared to most FPS shotguns which is a godsend for when you fast an onslaught of rushing flood.  The level has some really annoying parts though.  It constantly likes to spawn enemies like the exploding flood behind you, and even if you spot them sometimes they set off a chain reaction of grenades that will kill you.  The enemy spawners are also way too long.  Given how much repeatition is in the level it's unnecessary to have 5-6 spawn waves from a single vent.  Some seem to go forever and since they drop them behind you too you need to play fairly conservative by rushing to the spawn trigger and backing out.  All the while the little "popcorn" flood are everywhere, always, making it hard to recover your shield if you do get caught by a Flood shotgun blast.  For whatever the problems are though, you still can make general forward progress so it's a lot less frustrating than Truth and Reconciliation.

There's one difficult part where you are stuck between two locked doors and the Flood come in giving you no space to recover.  This can be cheesed by hiding before the first wave and waiting it out.  Pretty much necessary on legendary.
