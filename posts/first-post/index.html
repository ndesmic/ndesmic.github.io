            <p>This is the first post of the blog, currently built by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first real experience using eleventy.  I'm starting from scratch and landed on the <code>.liquid</code> templating.  I picked it mostly because that was what the tutorial I followed did and I needed to pick <em>something</em>.  I expect this site won't look good for a while and I'll need to learn a lot more to really get the value I want.  There's already so awkward things about the setup, but overall I'm like Eleventy so far.  It's a bit magic, but low config.</p>
